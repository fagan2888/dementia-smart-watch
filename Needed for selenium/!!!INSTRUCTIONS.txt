To run the tests a few things need to change.

You'll need to change the chromedriver location to where you have it throughout each test class.

You'll have to change your xampp folder set up so that all the web files are inside a folder called "assignment" and then all the links in the tests will work, i.e. localhost:8080/assignment/index.jsp

In order to run the tests you need to ensure you have the junit/hamcrest jars referenced as well as the selenium-server-standalone jar

Also before you run the addPatientTests make sure you run the patientListTests (if you're using a fresh database, otherwise do it the other way around)
